# Week_06
Week 6 - SQL- Part1

#5 In the readme for the repo explain what an RDBMS is and what SQL is briefly (under 250 words)
A database stores information in a way that is accessible, manageable, and updatable. A relational database stores information that is related in rows and columns.  A RDBMS is a system that provides an interface for people and programs to access data in the database in order to load, retrieve, and modify data.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language for interacting with relation databases. It allows users to query, view, and modify existing data.
